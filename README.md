# DeepNeuralNetwork-To-Predict-The-Heart-Disease
Deep Neural Network to predict the Heart disease. I have used one hidden layer which contains 1500 neurons. This is a binary classification problem which I implemented using Deep Neural Network which is also known as Artificial Neural Network. My model achieved an accuracy of 85% without overfitting of the data.
